<p>To enter into Roll20 manually, click the Journal icon (third icon 
from the left atop the right side of the screen), click "+Add" and 
select the "Character" option. (If the default D&amp;D 5e character 
sheet is not assigned to your campaign, check with your Roll20 DM or 
set-up admin.) If you see a pop-up asking "How do you want to create 
this character?" click the "Edit sheet directly" option.</p>

<p>Many character options, magic items and spells can be added directly 
by drag-and-dropping them from the built-in Roll20 Compendium (fourth 
icon from the left atop the right side of the screen, looked like an "i"
 inside a gray circle). However, this option often only works if you own
 or have been granted access to the appropriate Wizards of the Coast 
sourcebook within the Roll20 marketplace.</p>

<p>Under the "Character Sheet" tab, below are the variables to 
copy-and-paste under the CORE, BIO and SPELLS layouts of the D&amp;D5e

<h3>GENERAL TIPS &amp; TRICKS WITH ROLL20</h3>

<p><strong>HOW TO SEND PRIVATE MESSAGES IN ROLL20</strong></p>

<p>The "whisper" command in Roll20 chat is formatted by using the /w 
command, the name of the player/character you are targeting, and then 
the text of the message.</p>

<p>/w gm "Sam tries Sleight Of Hand to pick pockets on Frodo and get that damn ring."</p>

<p>To "whisper" chat to other specific players in our group...</p>

<p>/w Gandalf "You notice Frodo no longer has the ring."<br>
/w Aragorn "You see Sam swipe the ring off Frodo's hand."<br>
/w Frodo "You suddenly feel as if a terrible burden has been lifted from your soul."<br>
/w Sam "You now have the ring, as it should be, precious."<br>
etc.</p>

<p><strong>MANUAL DICE ROLL EXAMPLES</strong></p>

<p>Clicking from the character sheet can roll with the character's 
appropriate modifiers, but manual dice rolls can be used instead. These 
examples to paste into chat use a +4 modifier, adjust as needed.</p>

<p>/r 1d20+4 (standard roll)<br>
/r 1d20kh1+4 (roll with advantage)<br>
/r 1d20kl1+4 (roll with disadvantage)</p>

<p>Or better, for ability checks, saving throws, attack rolls), second number only used for Advantage/Disadvantage...</p>

<p>***Roll result:*** [[ 1d20+4 ]] | [[ 1d20+4 ]]</p>

<p>Option for attack details...</p>

<p>***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: [[ 1d20+4 ]] to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* [[ 1d6+1 ]] slashing damage.</p>

<p><strong>OTHER TIPS</strong></p>

<p>Some of you may already know all these, but FYI...</p>

<p>* To break out game chat into its own window, double-click the 
"talking balloon" icon in the upper left of the Roll20 screen. This way 
also allows you to make the chat column wider on your screen.</p>

<p>* Left-click and hold over the map to trigger those "ping" colored 
circles. The GM can shift-left-click to force all players' view to focus
 on the selected point.</p>

<p>* Double-clicking on the header of either a character sheet or a 
handout screen will minimize it into a faded/transparent button you can 
drag elsewhere on the view. Double-click the button to expand back to 
the original view, or (x) to close it out.</p>

<p>* Shift-double-click on a token to open its character sheet (assuming you have control over that token).</p>

<p>* With the arrow pointer "Select/Move" tool active, right-click on 
the map to drag the viewable area around. (This way is easier than 
toggling to the "Pan View" tool or trying to use those narrow scroll 
bars.)</p>

<p><strong>CHARACTER-SPECIFIC MACROS</strong></p>

<p>Copy and paste the block for a simple clean result in the Roll20 chat
 list. For Advantage or Disadvantage, paste into chat twice. These 
options can also be set up under the Marco button in Roll20 and even 
made into buttons.</p>

<p>***Bless.*** *Spell Bonus.* Add [[ 1d4 ]] to your attack "to hit" roll or saving throw.</p>

<p>***Guidance.*** *Spell Bonus.* Add [[ 1d4 ]] to your ability check / skill roll.</p>

<p>***Hex.*** *Spell Bonus.* Add [[ 1d6 ]] necrotic damage to your 
damage. (If target drops to 0 h.p., shift hex to new creature as bonus 
action.)</p>

<p>***Resistance.*** *Spell Bonus.* Add [[ 1d4 ]] to your saving throw roll. (May be added after the save roll has been made.)</p>
